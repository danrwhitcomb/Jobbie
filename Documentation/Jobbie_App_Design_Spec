The primary role of the application side of the Jobbie system
is to act as an interface and shell between the user and data.
Very little processing (apart from messages, user interaction, and graphics)
should be done be the application, most data processing is handled by the server


+-----------------Requirements-----------------+
In no particular order

1. Process user interaction
2. Send and receive data requests to the server
3. Display data 
4. Handle customized user accounts


+------------------Data Flow-------------------+
---Upon Login---
1. A connection is made to the server
2. Request for user account profile is sent
3. A thread separate from the primary thread handles retrieving the user info
4. User info is received and delegated into its correct places
(settings, profile, etc)
5. Job info is loaded and parsed to match previous state.


---Upon match selection---
1. Current job info is moved into the match datastructure
2. Job info is removed from opportunities data structure
3. Information on center view is ticked forward one place

---Upon x selection---
1. Data is removed from opportunity data structure

---Upon Data Reset---
1. Full data set is requested from the server be the application
2. All data structures are reset within the application
3. Data is parsed and delegated to correct data structure


+---------------------Notes---------------------+
- See implementation spec for details on data structures 
- It may be possible to use machine learning algorithms to further tailor
results after initial data retrieval.
