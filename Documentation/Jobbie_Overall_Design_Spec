The Jobbie system relies on simple movement of job posting information
to the user. The most important aspect of the application is getting the 
data from the source (existing job boards) to the application and effectively the user. 


+-----------------------REQUIREMENTS-------------------------+
In no particular order

1. Data transfered to app quickly. 
2. Data is effectively sorted to the user's requirements
3. Data is consistently up to date. 

+-----------------------DATA FLOW-----------------------+
This section outlines how data will generally move between the existing job databases 
to the Jobbie application on the iPhone. 

---Retrieving data from job boards-----
1. A central server fetches data from various job boards at a regular interval (yet to be determined)
2. The server processes data into its own database (most likely in SQLite)


---Upon new data request--- (request flow outlined in application design spec)
1. Thread receives request and passes information off to another process
handle full data parsing
2. Message from application contains specifics about job information requested - thread parses
information from database and returns a SQLite message to the application
3. If user is requesting new data, it is checked against the data currently referenced by the user profile
4. Data is sent to application
5. Application parses information out of SQLite message and displays to user


---Upon user login---
1. Listener thread receives account request and passes off to another process. 
2. New process handles the retrieval of saved user data, preferences, and job nodes
3. Process sends information to the application in the form of a SQLite message
4. Application parses data and alters settings based on user profile

---Upon Match List request---
1. Listener process receives request and passes off to different program
2. Program will be some type of open source that can send emails.
