			JOBBIE - SERVER DESIGN SPEC

The server's primary role is collection, organization, and distribution
of user and job data. 

+-------------------Requirements-------------------+
In no particular order
1. Collect job data from multiple sources using APIs
2. Distribute data into server database 
3. Respond to user application requests 
	a. Handle user accounts
	b. Handle job information 
4. Return data based on user's profile


+-------------------Data Flow-----------------------+
----Retrieving Data----
1. On a regular time interval, the server makes data requests to various
job boards
2. As data is received by each job board, the data is parsed, and stored into
a SQLite Database
3. As each piece of data gets parsed out of the job APIs, it is checked against the 
current database to make sure it isnt already present (hopefully the APIs will 
allow the request of postings within a time period)

---Upon User Profile/Account Request---
1. User account credentials are received from application
2. Account info is cross checked with database
	- If match, continue
	- If not, send message to application with denial message
3. User account info is loaded into SQLite message
4. Data is sent to application

---Upon Data Retrieval Request----
1. Job retrieval request is received from application
2. Relevant jobs are retrieved from the database
3. Jobs retrieved are cross checked with user account settings
4. Doubles, matched, and x-ed jobs are parsed out
5. Job data is wrapped into SQLite message
6. Message is sent to Application
